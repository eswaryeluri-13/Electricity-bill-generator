# Electricity-bill-generator

The project “Electricity bill printing system” is designed for users to give their information for the process of printing electricity bill, display bill 
and exit the system. Some information is included to know about the calculation of additional charges and extra charges on the bill printed. From this mini project, we have got a vivid idea and grip on how to use a few C-concepts of such as arrays, If-else statements, strings, switch and nested switch statements in the program.
